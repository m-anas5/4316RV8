The project focuses on programming the Mitsubishi RV-8CRL robot for efficient box pelletizing in a warehouse setting, and several major expenses are expected. The investment of a software license for programming the robot is required, ensuring that the RV-8CRL's capabilities are fully utilized and seamlessly melded into the preferred pelletization process and investment in a Mitsubishi Gripper, tailored to the specifications and requirements of the RV-8CRL robot, is essential to enable the precise handling of boxes during the pelletization task. Functional units necessary for the robot's seamless operation, including sensors for safety and coordination and any customized fixtures to optimize the pelletizing process, are crucial components of the project's expenditure. 

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}

For the project's future development, several additional components are being considered to enhance the capabilities and efficiency of the Mitsubishi RV-8CRL robot in its box pelletizing application the will be added in future documents.
