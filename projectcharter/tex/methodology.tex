In this project, we improve and teach Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Robot, RV8, to execute specific tasks. Safety enhancements include the integration of new lighting systems and emergency stop mechanisms for operator protection. The RV8's 8 controllable joints, accessible via the Robot Teaching Box, enable precise control, with the robot capable of autonomous learning, manual movement execution, and object manipulation via a vision sensor. Various algorithms are integrated to enhance task efficiency. Future plans involve attaching an end-effector for object manipulation. Through this methodology, we aim to harness the RV8's capabilities while ensuring safety and efficiency in a range of tasks, with an eye toward future developments.
