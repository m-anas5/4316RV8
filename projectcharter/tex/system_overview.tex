The Mitsubishi RV-8CRL robot, an 8-axis industrial robotic system with a payload capacity of 8 kg and 6 degrees of freedom, has been selected for pelletizing stacks of boxes in a warehouse. The purpose is to program the robot to efficiently handle and collect boxes in response to human input, using its rotational axes for precise motion and coordination. The RV-8CRL robot exhibits an 8-axis composition, allowing much freedom and versatility in action. Each axis of trajectory is leveraged for careful handling of boxes during pelletization. With an 8 kg load capacity, the robot is capable of lifting and managing standard containers normally encountered in storage environments. Integrated detectors are employed to monitor and detect human activity within the workspace. These sensors are essential in ensuring protection by allowing the robot to adjust its movements and avoid bodily injuries during function. The programming of the RV-8CRL robot involves developing a predefined sequence of stages for pelletizing packages. The series includes motions like identifying the target container, picking it up, deciding the optimal placement, and unleashing the box in the preferred pellet arrangement. In the context of box pelletizing, the RV-8CRL robot's programming enables it to handle stacks of boxes seamlessly. It picks up individual boxes, aligns them according to the chosen pellet configuration, and precisely places them, optimizing the pelletized stack's stability and organization.
