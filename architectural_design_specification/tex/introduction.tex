This product is a high level working prototype of an industrial level robot which serves the purpose of ordering and arranging the boxes by scanning the QR codes. The boxes will be picked by a gripper (custom designed) and will be sorted. The robot arm is connected to a PLC controller and the arm is set on to an additional axis (i.e. linear rail) which is also connected to a servo amplifier present in the PLC. This PLC controller is connected to a PC containing various software to control the robot arm. Raspberry Pi is used for the QR code detection and decision making which is connected to a camera.
