Though the RV8-CRL is housed in the Engineering Research Building, this particular project contains several modular hardware and software components that can be packaged for implementation to other workcells that house the RV8-CRL. This makes it possible to replicate the RV8-CRL's capabilities in other locations, without having to rebuild the entire system from scratch.

\subsection{Hardware components}
\subsubsection{Description}
The hardware components will be placed in a labeled box in the workcell, and will include the airbrush, air compressor, sensors, extra wiring, canvas, and any other hardware components that are necessary to implement the RV8-CRL project in another working environment. This also will include a USB drive.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
There may be several different wires and hardware components, which can become disorganized if not labeled properly.
\subsubsection{Standards}
There are no applicable standards.
\subsubsection{Priority}
Moderate

\subsection{Software components}
\subsubsection{Description}
All programs, code, scripts, and software will be written to a USB drive, as well as uploaded to a shared version control system GitHub repository.
