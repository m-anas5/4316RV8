This section provides the reader with an overview of the RV8 robot work cell. The primary operational aspects of the product, from the perspective of end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the work cell, as well as critical user interactions are described in detail below.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The RV8 work cell will specialize in palletizing and depalletizing boxes. It will perform these operations through the use of a hydraulic gripper, vision sensors, and QR code scanners. The vertical robot initially has 6 axis, with a linear rail acting as the 7th axis. The robot will stack boxes on pallets, sorting the boxes through the use of scanner data. While performing the operation, several safety features will be implemented, such as emergency stops, industrial light towers, and presence detection within the work cell. The integrated components of the work cell are the programmable logic controller (PLC), host PC, and a CR800 handheld controller.
