This section provides the reader with an overview of the RV8 robot work cell. The primary operational aspects of the product, from the perspective of end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the work cell, as well as critical user interactions are described in detail below.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The RV8 work cell will specialize in precisely marking on an object incorporating all aspects of the robot arm and linear rail. It will perform these operations through the use of a compressor which will be connected to the PLC. The vertical robot initially has 6 axis, with a linear rail acting as the 7th axis. The robot will precisely paint, where the system will send signal to the compressor which will output the paint on a plastic sheet. While performing the operation, several safety features will be implemented, such as emergency stops, and industrial light towers. The integrated components of the work cell are the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), host PC, and a CR800 handheld controller.
