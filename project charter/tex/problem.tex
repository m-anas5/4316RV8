Devices with many features are now common. This means that things like how heavy a product is, how well it is made, and how exact it is have become more important. To add more functions and sensors while also making things lighter, we need smaller parts and very detailed designs. Even small mistakes can be really serious, especially if they involve people's lives, so being very exact is extremely important. These complicated tasks often need skills that humans might struggle with. Tasks that need a lot of focus, like doing the same thing over and over, are often done better and more accurately by robots than by people. Robot arms are a great solution for this, as they are efficient, adaptable, and very exact when doing complicated things. The main goal of smart manufacturing is to make production more efficient, improve the quality of products, and make sure that production is safe. Robot arms, because they are so flexible and exact, are great for doing all kinds of complicated tasks. This project aims to make robot arms even better at meeting the needs of users by tackling these complicated challenges. By doing this, it helps improve smart manufacturing practices, encouraging new ideas and high standards in many different industries.
