As technology rapidly evolves, devices with increasingly complex functionalities have become ubiquitous. Consequently, factors such as product weight, completeness, and precision have gained greater importance. Accommodating additional functions and sensors while simultaneously reducing weight demands smaller component sizes and intricate design solutions. In sectors where even minor errors can lead to significant consequences, particularly those involving human life, precision is of paramount importance. These complex tasks often push the limits of human capabilities. Furthermore, tasks requiring sustained concentration, such as repetitive actions or imitation that do not necessarily involve creativity, can be executed more efficiently and accurately by robots than by humans. Robot arms emerge as a compelling solution, offering efficiency, adaptability, and precision for executing intricate operations. The overarching goal of intelligent manufacturing is to enhance production efficiency, elevate product quality, and ensure production safety. Robot arms, with their inherent flexibility and precision, empower the execution of diverse and complex tasks. This project aims to further empower robot arms, enabling them to meet user objectives by addressing these multifaceted challenges. In doing so, it significantly contributes to the advancement of intelligent manufacturing practices, fostering innovation and excellence across various industries.
