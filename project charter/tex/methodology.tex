In this project, we focus on using the Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Robot, RV8, to perform precise tasks. Our main goal is to improve safety by integrating innovative lighting systems that show progress visually and by adding multiple emergency stop mechanisms in the robot's controller for immediate halting in emergencies. We make use of the RV8's capabilities, especially its 8 controllable joints that can be accessed through the Robot Teaching Box, allowing us to control its movements precisely. Moreover, we utilize the robot's ability to learn manual movements through a teaching mode. To make the robot execute tasks intelligently, we integrate various algorithms into its control system seamlessly. Additionally, we have plans for future developments, such as attaching an end effector and implementing a rail system to expand the robot's workspace. These enhancements will enable the robot to effectively grasp and manipulate a wide range of objects. Throughout these activities, our main focus is on ensuring safety and optimizing operational efficiency, so that the RV8 robot can perform at its best across a variety of tasks.
