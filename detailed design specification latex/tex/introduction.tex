This product is a high level working prototype of an industrial level robot which serves the purpose of spraying, coating, painting, and more uses due to their high flexibility and protection. The prototype will spray paint to the specific area designated to spary with paint ball marker. The robot arm is connected to a PLC controller and the arm is set on to an additional axis (i.e. linear rail) which is also connected to a servo amplifier present in the PLC. This PLC controller is connected to a PC containing various software to control the robot arm. Welcome to the future of seamless and superior surface finishing, where our robot not only meets but exceeds the demands of the most intricate and challenging projects.
