This product is a high level working prototype of an industrial level robot which serves the purpose of applying paint to automotive and aerial vehicle parts for various purposes, such as protection, aesthetics and branding. The paint is sprayed using an airbrush. The air brush is connected to an air compressor which is controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC). This robot arm is set on a linear rail which serves as the 7th joint (additional axis). There are two inductive switches placed on the ends of of linear rail signalling the end of the rail which are also connected to PLC.
